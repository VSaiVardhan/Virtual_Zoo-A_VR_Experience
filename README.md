# Virtual Zoo - A VR Experience
The Virtual Zoo is a groundbreaking Virtual Reality (VR)
experience developed as a core project under the CS344 -
Introduction to Metaverse course. This innovative endeavor
reimagines the traditional zoo concept by transporting it into
a fully immersive and interactive digital environment.
The project seeks to replicate the atmosphere and functionality of a real-world zoo while offering an enriched and ethical
alternative to conventional zoos. With detailed 3D modeling,
realistic animal behaviors, and educational components, users
can explore a vibrant digital space populated with lifelike
animals, rich landscapes, and interactive learning modules.
The Virtual Zoo serves as both an educational tool and a
source of entertainment, making it suitable for a wide audience
including school students, wildlife enthusiasts, educators, and
the general public. Its virtual nature eliminates geographical
barriers and logistical constraints, enabling global access while
promoting animal welfare and wildlife conservation.
